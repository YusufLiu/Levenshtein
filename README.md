# Levenshtein
A function used to find the distance between words 

In information theory, linguistics and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

This repo contains the implementation of Levenshtein distance in Scala and Python, with some additional functionality like closest word.

The main purpose of the levenshtein function is used for data cleaning and generalization for supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.
